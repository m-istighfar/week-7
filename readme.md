# Financial Tracker Application

## Introduction

The Financial Tracker Application is a web-based tool developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS technologies that provide a simple and efficient way to keep track of your financial transactions. This application is aimed at helping individuals manage their finances by allowing them to record, update, and monitor their income and expenditures.

**Key Aspects of the Application:**

1. The application provides a user-friendly interface that requires minimal technical knowledge for operation.
2. It uses the local storage of your web browser to store the transaction data. Therefore, your transaction history is preserved between browser sessions.
3. It's important to note that while local storage is convenient for storing data, it should not be used for highly sensitive information as the data can be cleared if the browser cache is cleared.

This application includes a specific sequence of operations that are represented in the form of a flowchart. This sequence starts from the initialization of the application and ends with the user successfully performing various operations like adding, updating, deleting, or filtering transactions.

## Features

### 1. Add Transactions

The main function of this application is to enable users to add their financial transactions. For each transaction, you must provide the following details:

- Date of the transaction.
- Type of the transaction, which can be either 'Kas Masuk' (Income) or 'Kas Keluar' (Expense).
- The name or description of the transaction.
- The amount involved in the transaction.

### 2. Display Transactions

The application will display all your transactions in a tabular format. This table provides a comprehensive view of your income and expenses, allowing you to monitor your transactions easily.

### 3. Display Total Amounts

The application automatically calculates and displays the total amounts of your income and expenses. It also shows the balance, which is the difference between your total income and total expenses.

### 4. Filter and Search Transactions

Filtering and search functionalities allow you to easily find specific transactions. You can filter the transactions based on their type ('Kas Masuk' or 'Kas Keluar'). In addition, the search feature allows you to find transactions by their names.

### 5. Update Transactions

If you have entered incorrect information for a transaction, you can update the details using the 'Update' function. The application will prompt you to enter the updated details, and the changes will be reflected immediately in your transaction list.

### 6. Delete Transactions

If you wish to remove a particular transaction from your list, you can do so using the 'Delete' function.

### 7. Clear All Data

If you wish to clear all transaction data, you can use the 'Clear All' function. This will remove all transaction data from the application as well as from the local storage of your browser.
